# Film Finder

**App that suggests the best films and series for you, in a personalized way and with the help of AI.**


The FilmFinder app has **two ways to search**: **select** from the various **predefined categories**, or **write** - in your own words - the type of movie/series you are looking for. You'll be given **three options** that best suit you, and if you don't like any of them, you can click on the **download** button for new suggestions!

All the movies you've recommended will be recorded in your **History**, so you can always check them out again later.

The app also has a **Favorites** function, where you can save suggested films so you don't forget them. What's more, if FilmFinder suggests a movie you've already watched, select it as "Watched" and the app won't recommend it again!
